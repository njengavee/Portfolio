          Throughout my work I have been able to delve in to a variety of
          programming skills.My preferred field is Backend development using PHP
          and laravel, though I also have alot of experience working with Nodejs
          and Express. I have also worked with React to create fullstack
          applications. Overall, all these experiences have helped me to become
          a well rounded developer.
